Last updated: November 15, 2025
Contact: You can contact the owner via Discord (User: the_bullet) or through our business email bumbot.contact@gmail.com.

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains what information BumBot (“the Bot”) collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.
BumBot is a Discord bot used for managing and monitoring a Minecraft server hosted through the PlayHosting / Pterodactyl panel.

By using the Bot, you agree to the terms in this Privacy Policy.

2. Information the Bot Collects

BumBot collects only the minimum necessary information required for operation.
Some data is collected automatically by Discord as part of normal bot interactions.

2.1 Data Collected Automatically

The bot receives the following information when you use commands or interact with buttons:

Your Discord User ID

Username and Discriminator / Display Name

Message content (only when using slash commands input fields)

Interaction timestamps

Server and channel IDs used during interactions

This information is required for basic bot functionality and moderation logging.

2.2 Optional or Generated Data

The bot may temporarily store (in memory or logs):

Server status results (ping, version, players online)

Logs of commands executed (in a local log file on the bot host machine)

Error or system events for debugging purposes

2.3 Data the Bot Does NOT Collect

BumBot does NOT collect or store:

IP addresses

Email addresses

Payment information

Passwords or authentication tokens

Personal or sensitive data

Any private message contents (unless the bot is directly DM’d)

BumBot also never sells user data or shares it with third parties.

3. Why the Bot Collects Data

BumBot only collects the minimal data needed to:

Authenticate command permissions

Provide Minecraft server management features

Send private admin reports

Maintain server logs for debugging

Prevent unauthorized button interactions

Respond to slash commands

Without this data, the bot would not be able to function.

4. How Long Data is Stored
4.1 Log File

BumBot keeps a small local log file (log.txt) that contains:

Command usage records

Error messages

Server status checks

This file is overwritten when cleared using the /server log_clear command.

Logs typically persist until manually cleared or overwritten.

4.2 No permanent database

BumBot does not store any information in a long-term database.

5. Who Has Access to the Data

Only the owner of BumBot (Bullet) has access to the bot’s log file and internal data.

No other users, moderators, or developers can access this information by default.

The bot does NOT share data with:

Third parties

Advertising companies

Analytics services

External developers

6. Data Security

BumBot uses:

Secure hosting with access restricted to the bot owner

Environment variables to protect tokens

No external API that stores user data

While no system is perfectly secure, all reasonable precautions are taken to prevent unauthorized access.

7. User Rights

Users can:

Request removal of any logged data associated with their ID

Request clarification about what the bot stores

Request the bot to stop responding to them (by blocking it)

8. Children's Privacy

BumBot does not knowingly collect information from users under age 13.
If such data is found, it will be deleted immediately upon request.

9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

The owner may update this Privacy Policy occasionally.
When updated, the Last updated date at the top will change.

Continued use of the bot after changes are made means you accept the updated policy.
